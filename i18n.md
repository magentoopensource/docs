# i18n Documentation

[TOC]

## Introduction

Internationalization, often abbreviated as i18n, is the process of designing and developing software applications that
can be easily adapted to different languages and cultures. In the context of web development, it refers to the ability
to make a website or web application accessible and adaptable to users from different regions and linguistic
backgrounds. This documentation will provide an overview of i18n concepts and explain how to implement them using PHP
and Magento 2.

## Localization vs Internationalization

Before diving into the details of i18n, it is essential to understand the difference between localization and
internationalization. Localization, abbreviated as l10n, refers to the process of adapting software to a specific locale
or language. It involves translating the user interface, content, and other elements to suit the target audience's
preferences. Internationalization, on the other hand, is the process of designing and developing software in a way that
makes it easy to localize.

## Internationalization in Magento 2

Magento 2, a popular e-commerce platform, provides robust support for internationalization. It offers features and
functionalities that allow developers to build multilingual online stores easily. Some of the key elements of
internationalization in Magento 2 include:

### Translation Files

Magento 2 employs a translation mechanism that uses CSV files to store translations for different languages. Each CSV
file contains a mapping between the original phrases and their translated counterparts. These files are organized under
the `i18n` directory in a module or theme.

For example, to translate a phrase in English to Spanish, you need to create a CSV file named `es_ES.csv` (assuming the
target locale is Spanish) and place it in the appropriate module or theme directory. The content of the CSV file would
look like this:

```csv
"Hello","Hola"
"Welcome","Bienvenido"
```

### Translation Functions

Magento 2 provides translation functions that enable developers to translate text directly within their code. These
functions automatically retrieve the translated version of a phrase based on the current locale.

The primary translation function in Magento 2 is `__('phrase')`, which is similar to the `gettext` function in PHP. This
function takes a phrase as an argument and returns the translated version of the phrase based on the current locale. For
example:

```php
echo __("Hello"); // Output depends on the current locale
```

### Locale-Specific Formatting

Different locales have different formatting conventions for numbers, currencies, dates, and times. Magento 2
incorporates the `Intl` extension to handle locale-specific formatting requirements. The `Intl` extension provides
classes and functions to format numbers, currencies, dates, and times based on the current locale.

For instance, to format a date in a locale-specific manner, you can use
the `Magento\Framework\Stdlib\DateTime\TimezoneInterface` class. Here's an example:

```php
/** @var \Magento\Framework\Stdlib\DateTime\TimezoneInterface $timezone */
$timezone->formatDateTime($date, \IntlDateFormatter::MEDIUM, \IntlDateFormatter::SHORT);
```

### Locale-Specific Configuration

Magento 2 allows developers to configure various aspects of their store based on the current locale. For instance, you
can set the default currency for a specific locale, define locale-specific date and time formats, and configure
locale-specific tax rules.

To configure locale-specific settings in Magento 2, you can navigate to the admin panel, select "Stores" from the main
menu, and then choose "Configuration." From there, you can modify various settings under the "General" and "Currency
Setup" sections.

## Conclusion

Internationalization is a crucial aspect of modern web development, especially for applications targeting a global
audience. Magento 2 provides developers with robust tools and features to implement i18n seamlessly. By utilizing
translation files, translation functions, locale-specific formatting, and configuration options, developers can create
multilingual and culturally adaptable online stores.
