# Directory Structure Documentation

[TOC]

## Introduction

This documentation provides an in-depth understanding of the directory structure used in PHP and Magento 2 projects. A
well-organized and logical directory structure is crucial for efficient development and maintenance of complex
applications. By following the recommended structure, developers can easily locate, modify, and extend code while
adhering to best practices. This documentation will outline the main directories, their purposes, and provide specific
examples and code snippets to illustrate the concepts.

## Root Directory

The root directory of a PHP or Magento 2 project contains essential files and directories necessary for the project to
function. Let's examine the common files and directories found in this root directory:

1. **app**: This directory contains the majority of your application code and configuration files. It is the heart of
   the Magento 2 application and contains several subdirectories, including:

    - **code**: This directory is home to your custom PHP modules, organized by vendor name and module name. For
      instance, if you have a module named "MyModule" developed by "MyVendor," the directory structure would
      be `app/code/MyVendor/MyModule`.

    - **design**: This directory contains your theme-specific files, such as HTML templates, CSS stylesheets, and
      JavaScript files. The structure follows the same pattern as the `code` directory, with themes organized by vendor
      name and theme name.

    - **etc**: The `etc` directory holds configuration files for various aspects of your application, including module
      configuration, database scripts, and system configuration settings. The structure mirrors the `code` directory,
      with subdirectories for each module and theme.

    - **i18n**: This directory is used for internationalization (i18n) purposes. It contains translation files for
      different languages, allowing your application to be easily localized. Translations are organized by module and
      theme.

    - **view**: The `view` directory is where you define the front-end presentation of your application. It contains
      subdirectories like `frontend` and `adminhtml` for different areas of your application. Each area has its own set
      of directories for layout, templates, and web assets.

    - **vendor**: This directory is created when you install dependencies using Composer. It contains all the
      third-party libraries and modules your project depends on. It is generally recommended not to modify files in this
      directory directly.

    - **composer.json**: This file specifies the project's dependencies and other metadata required by Composer for
      managing dependencies and autoloading.

    - **index.php**: The `index.php` file is the entry point of your Magento 2 application. It initializes the Magento
      framework and processes incoming requests.

    - **.htaccess**: This file contains Apache web server configuration directives, such as URL rewrite rules and
      security settings. It helps control access to files and directories.

2. **bin**: This directory contains command-line scripts used for various development tasks. For Magento 2 projects, it
   includes useful scripts like `magento` for running CLI commands and `setup` for installing and upgrading the
   application.

3. **dev**: The `dev` directory is used for development-specific tools and configurations. It may contain additional
   scripts, debugging utilities, or profiling tools.

4. **pub**: This directory houses publicly accessible files that are served directly by the web server. It includes
   files like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript that can be accessed by users. Magento places its static assets in
   directories like `static`, `media`, and `frontend`.

5. **var**: This directory is used for storing various types of data generated by the application at runtime. It
   typically includes log files, compiled code, caches, sessions, and generated static files. You should ensure this
   directory is writable by the web server.

6. **vendor**: Similar to the `vendor` directory in the `app` directory, this directory contains all the third-party
   libraries and modules your project depends on. It is managed by Composer and should not be modified directly.

## Conclusion

Understanding the directory structure of a PHP or Magento 2 project is crucial for efficient development and
maintenance. By following the recommended structure outlined in this documentation, developers can easily navigate and
manage their codebase, resulting in a more organized and maintainable application. Use the provided examples and code
snippets to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts discussed. Happy coding!
