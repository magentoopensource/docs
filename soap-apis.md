# SOAP APIs Documentation

[TOC]

## Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using SOAP APIs in PHP with Magento 2. It aims to equip developers
with the necessary knowledge and skills to successfully integrate and interact with SOAP APIs in their applications. The
document assumes a familiarity with PHP and Magento 2 concepts, such as object-oriented programming and web services.

## 1. What is SOAP?

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services. It allows
applications to communicate over HTTP using XML-based messages. SOAP APIs provide a standardized way of interacting with
remote systems and accessing their functionality.

Magento 2 offers a set of SOAP APIs to enable developers to integrate and interact with its e-commerce platform. These
APIs provide access to various resources, such as products, customers, orders, and more. By utilizing SOAP APIs,
developers can leverage the power of Magento 2 in their own applications.

## 2. Setting Up a SOAP Client

To interact with a SOAP API in PHP, you need to set up a SOAP client. The SOAP client acts as a bridge between your
application and the remote SOAP server.

Here's an example of setting up a SOAP client in PHP using the built-in `SoapClient` class:

```php
// Specify the WSDL URL of the SOAP server
$wsdlUrl = 'https://example.com/soap?wsdl';

// Create a new instance of the SOAP client
$client = new SoapClient($wsdlUrl);

// Optionally, configure additional options
$options = [
    'trace' => true, // Enable tracing of SOAP requests and responses
    // Add more options if needed
];

// Pass the options to the SOAP client constructor
$client = new SoapClient($wsdlUrl, $options);
```

In the example above, we create a new instance of the `SoapClient` class by passing the WSDL URL of the SOAP server. We
can also provide additional options, such as enabling tracing of SOAP requests and responses.

## 3. Making SOAP Requests

Once you have set up a SOAP client, you can start making SOAP requests to the remote server. A SOAP request typically
consists of a method call with optional parameters.

To invoke a SOAP method, you need to know its name and the expected parameters. The method names and parameter
structures are defined in the WSDL (Web Services Description Language) provided by the SOAP server.

Here's an example of making a SOAP request in PHP using a SOAP client:

```php
// Invoke a SOAP method
$result = $client->someMethod('param1', 'param2');

// Process the result
if ($result->success) {
    // Handle successful response
    $data = $result->data;
} else {
    // Handle error response
    $error = $result->error;
}
```

In the example above, we invoke the `someMethod` SOAP method with two parameters ('param1' and 'param2'). The result of
the method call is stored in the `$result` variable. We can then access the response data or handle any errors
accordingly.

## 4. Handling SOAP Responses

SOAP responses can have different structures depending on the specific API method being called. It's important to
understand the response structure to extract the relevant data.

The response structure is defined in the WSDL provided by the SOAP server. You can inspect the WSDL or refer to the API
documentation to understand the response structure for each SOAP method.

Here's an example of handling a SOAP response in PHP:

```php
// Invoke a SOAP method
$result = $client->someMethod('param1', 'param2');

// Check if the SOAP request was successful
if ($result->success) {
    // Handle successful response
    $data = $result->data;
} else {
    // Handle error response
    $error = $result->error;
}
```

In the example above, we check the `success` property of the `$result` object to determine if the SOAP request was
successful. If it is, we can access the response data using the `data` property. Otherwise, we handle the error using
the `error` property.

## 5. Examples

To help illustrate the concepts discussed above, here are some concrete examples of using SOAP APIs in PHP with Magento
2:

- Example 1: Retrieving a list of products from the catalog.
- Example 2: Creating a new customer account.
- Example 3: Placing an order for a product.

Each example will provide step-by-step instructions and code snippets to guide you through the process.

## Conclusion

This documentation has covered the basics of using SOAP APIs in PHP with Magento 2. By following the guidelines and
examples provided, you should now be equipped to integrate and interact with SOAP APIs effectively. Remember to consult
the API documentation and the WSDL provided by the SOAP server for detailed information on specific API methods and
response structures. Happy coding!
