# Functional Testing Documentation

[TOC]

## 1. Introduction

Functional testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring that the software meets the specified
functional requirements. This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive guide on performing functional testing using
PHP and Magento 2.

Functional testing involves testing the individual functions or features of an application to ensure they work correctly
and meet the expected behavior. It focuses on validating the application's behavior against the defined requirements.

## 2. Test Environment Setup

Before starting the functional testing, it is essential to set up the test environment properly. Here are the steps to
follow:

1. Install and configure Magento 2: Set up a local instance of Magento 2 for testing purposes. Follow the official
   Magento 2 installation documentation for detailed instructions.

2. Install and configure PHPUnit: PHPUnit is a popular testing framework for PHP. Install PHPUnit globally or as a
   project dependency using Composer. Create a `phpunit.xml` file in the project root directory to configure PHPUnit.
   Refer to the PHPUnit documentation for more details.

3. Prepare test data: Create sample data or utilize existing data to ensure meaningful tests. For example, if testing an
   e-commerce website, create test products, customers, and orders for various scenarios.

## 3. Test Case Design

Test case design is a critical phase in functional testing. Well-designed test cases ensure comprehensive coverage and
effective validation of the application's functionality. Here's how to design effective test cases:

1. Identify test scenarios: Analyze the requirements and identify different scenarios that need to be tested. For
   instance, if testing an e-commerce website, scenarios may include adding products to the cart, updating the cart
   quantity, and placing an order.

2. Define test steps: Break down each scenario into a series of steps. Be specific and detailed in defining the steps to
   ensure reproducibility.

3. Create test data: Determine the necessary data for each test case. This may involve creating or manipulating existing
   data to execute the test steps successfully.

4. Write test assertions: Define the expected outcomes for each test case. Assertions should be clear and concise,
   defining what should be true after executing the test steps.

```php
// Example test case using PHPUnit and Magento 2
public function testAddToCart()
{
    // Step 1: Go to the product page
    $this->browser->navigateTo('/product-page');

    // Step 2: Add the product to the cart
    $this->browser->click('.add-to-cart-button');

    // Step 3: Check if the cart page is loaded
    $this->browser->assertPageLoaded('/cart');

    // Assertion: Verify that the product was added to the cart
    $this->browser->assertElementExists('.cart-product');
}
```

## 4. Test Execution

Once the test cases are designed, it's time to execute them to validate the application's functionality. Follow these
steps for successful test execution:

1. Run PHPUnit: Execute PHPUnit from the command line, specifying the test suite or individual test cases to run. The
   test execution will begin, and PHPUnit will display the progress and test results.

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite MyTestSuite
```

2. Monitor test execution: Keep an eye on the test execution process to identify any failures or errors. PHPUnit
   provides detailed error messages and stack traces to aid in debugging.

3. Debug and fix failures: In case of test failures, investigate the cause by analyzing the error messages and stack
   traces. Fix the underlying issues in the application code or test cases to resolve the failures.

4. Rerun failed tests: After fixing the failures, rerun the failed test cases to ensure they pass. This ensures the
   stability and reliability of the tests.

## 5. Test Reporting

Proper test reporting is crucial for record-keeping and identifying trends in test results. Use the following approaches
for effective test reporting:

1. Generate test reports: PHPUnit generates test reports in various formats, including HTML, XML, and JSON. Choose the
   format that suits your needs and generate the reports after each test execution.

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phpunit --log-junit test-results.xml
```

2. Analyze test results: Review the test reports to identify patterns, track progress, and identify any areas that need
   improvement. Look for failing test cases, error rates, and trends in test execution times.

3. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines: If using a continuous integration or delivery pipeline, integrate the test reports
   for automated tracking and analysis. This allows you to monitor the test results over time and ensure ongoing quality
   assurance.

## 6. Conclusion

Functional testing is crucial for ensuring the proper functioning of software applications. By following the steps
outlined in this documentation, you can effectively design, execute, and report on functional tests using PHP and
Magento 2.

Remember to continually enhance your test suite, incorporating new scenarios and edge cases as the application evolves.
This will help maintain a high level of quality and ensure that the application meets user expectations.
