# API Reference Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the API Reference Documentation for the Magento 2 API. This comprehensive guide will provide you with all the
necessary information to interact with the Magento 2 API programmatically using PHP.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using the Magento 2 API, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of PHP programming language
- Familiarity with Magento 2 architecture and concepts
- Access to a Magento 2 installation with API access enabled

## API Basics

Magento 2 provides a powerful API that allows you to interact with various aspects of the system, including customers,
products, orders, and more. The API is implemented using the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style
and is designed to be platform-agnostic.

To authenticate and interact with the API, you need to obtain an access token, which acts as a credential to
authenticate your requests. You can obtain an access token by authenticating with the Magento 2 OAuth server using your
credentials. Once you have the access token, you can use it to make authorized requests to the API.

## API Endpoints

The Magento 2 API is organized into several endpoints, each representing a different aspect of the system. The endpoints
provide a set of resources and operations that you can use to manipulate and retrieve data.

Here are some of the main API endpoints available in Magento 2:

### Customers

The Customers API endpoint allows you to manage customer-related information, such as creating new customers, retrieving
customer details, updating customer information, and more.

```php
// Example: Retrieve customer details
GET /rest/V1/customers/{customerId}
```

### Products

The Products API endpoint provides methods to manage product-related data, such as creating new products, retrieving
product information, updating product attributes, and more.

```php
// Example: Create a new product
POST /rest/V1/products
```

### Orders

The Orders API endpoint allows you to manage orders in Magento 2, including creating new orders, retrieving order
details, updating order status, and more.

```php
// Example: Retrieve order details
GET /rest/V1/orders/{orderId}
```

### Carts

The Carts API endpoint provides methods to manage shopping carts, including creating new carts, adding products to a
cart, retrieving cart details, and more.

```php
// Example: Create a new cart
POST /rest/V1/carts/mine
```

## Making API Requests

To make API requests, you can use any HTTP client library that supports sending HTTP requests. In PHP, you can use
libraries such as Guzzle, cURL, or the built-in `file_get_contents()` function.

Here's an example of making a GET request to retrieve customer details using the Guzzle HTTP client library:

```php
<?php

use GuzzleHttp\Client;

// Create a new Guzzle HTTP client instance
$client = new Client();

// Make a GET request to retrieve customer details
$response = $client->request('GET', 'https://example.com/rest/V1/customers/1', [
    'headers' => [
        'Authorization' => 'Bearer {access_token}',
        'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
    ],
]);

// Get the response body
$body = $response->getBody();

// Process the response data
$customer = json_decode($body, true);

// Print the customer details
echo "Customer Name: " . $customer['firstname'] . " " . $customer['lastname'];
```

## Error Handling

When interacting with the Magento 2 API, it's important to handle errors properly. The API returns meaningful error
messages and HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

Here's an example of handling errors when retrieving customer details:

```php
// Make a GET request to retrieve customer details
try {
    $response = $client->request('GET', 'https://example.com/rest/V1/customers/1', [
        'headers' => [
            'Authorization' => 'Bearer {access_token}',
            'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
        ],
    ]);
    
    // Get the response body
    $body = $response->getBody();

    // Process the response data
    $customer = json_decode($body, true);

    // Print the customer details
    echo "Customer Name: " . $customer['firstname'] . " " . $customer['lastname'];
} catch (\GuzzleHttp\Exception\RequestException $e) {
    // Handle request exceptions (e.g., connection errors, server errors, etc.)
    echo "Request Exception: " . $e->getMessage();
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // Handle other exceptions
    echo "Exception: " . $e->getMessage();
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now have a solid understanding of the Magento 2 API and how to interact with it using PHP. Refer to
the API documentation for further details on available endpoints, request/response formats, and additional
functionality.

Happy coding!
