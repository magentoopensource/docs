# Understanding E-commerce Security Threats

## Introduction

Security is a growth enabler. For a growing merchant, understanding e-commerce threats and how Magento (Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source) mitigates them leads to fewer outages, lower fraud, higher conversion, and sustained customer trust.

Applies to: Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source 2.4.4 and later. Edition differences are noted where applicable.

This page explains the top e-commerce threats (bots, web skimming, XSS/CSRF, credential stuffing), what Magento mitigates natively, what requires a WAF/CDN, and a 60-minute hardening checklist with exact admin paths.

## Key Concepts

- Credential stuffing and brute-force: Automated login attempts using leaked credentials targeting Admin and customer accounts.
- Web skimming (Magecart): Malicious JavaScript injection to steal cardholder data on checkout.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injection of scripts that run in customers' browsers.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Forged requests that exploit authenticated sessions.
- Injection attacks (SQLi/Command): Attempts to manipulate backend via unvalidated input, often via extensions.
- Bot/card testing and scraping: Automated abuse of checkout and catalog endpoints.
- DDoS/traffic floods: Volumetric or L7 attacks overwhelming infrastructure.
- Supply-chain/extension risk: Vulnerabilities introduced by third-party modules or CI/CD.
- Misconfiguration and outdated software: Default admin paths, weak passwords, HTTP (no TLS), unpatched versions.

## How It Works

Magento core mitigates many application-layer risks (CSRF, XSS, session security), but it does not itself block DDoS or large-scale bot floods. Use a WAF/CDN (Fastly WAF on Adobe Commerce on cloud, or a third‑party WAF for Open Source/self‑hosted) for network-layer and volumetric protection.

Magento native protections (2.4.4+):
- CSRF: Form keys on forms and Admin Secret Key in URLs mitigate CSRF.
- XSS: Input filtering and a Content Security Policy (CSP) framework. Test in Report-Only and then enforce.
- Session security: Secure and HttpOnly cookies, SameSite attributes, configurable session timeout (Stores > Settings > Configuration > Advanced > Admin > Security).
- Authentication hardening: Admin Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), password policy controls, account lockout.
- CAPTCHA: Built-in CAPTCHA (Stores > Configuration > Advanced > Admin > CAPTCHA; Customers > Customer Configuration > CAPTCHA) and Google reCAPTCHA (Stores > Settings > Configuration > Security > Google reCAPTCHA Admin Panel / Storefront).
- HTTPS: Force secure URLs (Stores > Settings > Configuration > General > Web > Base URLs (Secure)).

Requires infrastructure/CDN/WAF:
- DDoS/bot mitigation, L7 rate limiting, IP reputation, and bot management. Use Fastly WAF (Adobe Commerce on cloud) or third-party WAF (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly) for Open Source/self-hosted deployments.

Operational controls:
- Regular patching via Composer updates and security-only patches, extension vetting, and least-privilege roles (System > Permissions > User Roles).

## Benefits and Advantages

- Higher conversion with lower friction: Use Invisible reCAPTCHA on checkout and risk-based challenges to deter bots while minimizing customer friction.
- Reduced fraud and chargebacks: Combine gateway risk tools and reCAPTCHA to filter abuse before authorization.
- Greater uptime and resilience: WAF/CDN absorbs abusive traffic and rate-limits hot endpoints.
- Stronger compliance posture: Enforce HTTPS and Admin 2FA to support PCI DSS obligations and pass ASV scans.
- Clear observability: Track WAF blocks, login failures, and admin actions (Adobe Commerce) to respond faster.

Example KPIs to monitor:
- Checkout success rate, reCAPTCHA challenge rate, bot traffic percentage
- Chargeback rate and fraud review queue volume
- Uptime, WAF block counts, and average response time
- ASV scan pass rate and number of open security findings

## Common Challenges and Considerations

- CAPTCHA friction: Start with Invisible reCAPTCHA for storefront; escalate to v2 Checkbox or higher sensitivity only on suspicious traffic.
- Extension risk: Prefer Adobe Marketplace vendors, review update cadence, limit module count, and pen-test checkout after adding payment/custom JS.
- CSP rollout: Start in Report-Only, fix violations, then Enforce; whitelist only necessary domains (payments, analytics, tag managers).
- Admin access sprawl: Enforce 2FA, unique accounts, role-based access, and regular user reviews.
- Headless/PWA: Ensure CSP and reCAPTCHA are implemented in the frontend app; protect GraphQL endpoints with WAF rules and rate limits.

## Use Cases and Scenarios

- SMB B2C: Enable HTTPS, 2FA, Invisible reCAPTCHA, and monthly patching. Add WAF with basic rate limits for login/checkout.
- Enterprise B2C: Enforce CSP, deploy WAF with bot management, set adaptive rate limits for GraphQL and REST, and integrate SIEM monitoring.
- B2B: Prioritize 2FA, RBAC with least-privilege, IP allowlists for Admin/VPN, and WAF protections on quote and account endpoints.

## Alternatives and Comparisons

- Adobe Commerce on cloud: Includes Fastly CDN + WAF integration; managed shielding and TLS; ideal for merchants wanting integrated edge security.
- Magento Open Source/self-hosted: Pair with Cloudflare/Akamai/Fastly (paid) for WAF/bot mitigation; server hardening, TLS/HSTS, and monitoring are merchant/host responsibilities.
- Fraud tools: Compare gateway-native risk (e.g., Adyen, PayPal, Braintree) versus third-party fraud platforms; balance cost against chargeback reduction.

## Business Impact

### For Merchants

Track a KPI set and set 90-day targets:
- Conversion rate, checkout error rate, reCAPTCHA challenge rate
- Chargeback rate, fraud review queue volume
- WAF block count, bot traffic percentage, admin unauthorized attempt count

Suggested 90-day targets after implementing Invisible reCAPTCHA + WAF rules:
- Bot traffic: -50%
- Chargebacks: -30%
- Conversion: +0.5 to +1.0 percentage points

Simple ROI example:
If bot checkout attempts cause 1% false declines on 100k monthly sessions at AOV $80 and 2% base conversion, tightening reCAPTCHA and WAF rules can recover roughly 16 orders/month (~$1,280), often exceeding typical WAF costs.

### For Customers

- Greater trust and safety: Fewer skimming risks and consistent HTTPS.
- Lower friction: Invisible reCAPTCHA avoids unnecessary challenges for legitimate users.
- Stable experience: WAF shielding reduces downtime during abusive traffic spikes.

### For Operations

- Fewer incidents and faster response: Measurable WAF blocks, clear admin audit trails (Adobe Commerce), and improved monitoring.
- Predictable maintenance: Scheduled patching and extension hygiene lower emergency work.
- Improved compliance readiness: 2FA and secure configuration support PCI DSS requirements.

## Common Misconceptions

- "Magento blocks DDoS by itself" – False; use a WAF/CDN for DDoS and large-scale bot mitigation.
- "reCAPTCHA kills conversion" – Use Invisible or risk-based reCAPTCHA and apply selectively to minimize friction.
- "PCI doesn't apply if we use tokens" – SAQ scope is reduced, not eliminated; maintain HTTPS, patching, and secure processes.
- "Marketplace extensions are always safe" – Vet vendors, update promptly, and audit code when possible.
- "2FA can be disabled in production" – Do not disable in 2.4+; 2FA is required and critical for Admin security.

## Implementation Considerations

Note: Admin Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is required in 2.4+ (Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source). Configure under Stores > Settings > Configuration > Security > 2FA. Do not disable 2FA in production environments.

Edition note: Admin Actions Log (System > Actions Logs) is available in Adobe Commerce. For Magento Open Source, use server/application logs and third‑party extensions for admin auditing.

### Quick Wins (60 minutes)
1) Enforce HTTPS
- Path: Admin > Stores > Settings > Configuration > General > Web > Base URLs (Secure)
- Set "Use Secure URLs on Storefront" and "Use Secure URLs in Admin" to Yes.
- Verify: Padlock icon present across storefront and Admin.

2) Enable Google reCAPTCHA
- Path: Admin > Stores > Settings > Configuration > Security > Google reCAPTCHA Admin Panel and Storefront
- Recommendation: Use Invisible reCAPTCHA for checkout.
- Verify: reCAPTCHA network calls present; challenges appear only on risky interactions.

3) Harden Admin security
- Path: Admin > Stores > Settings > Configuration > Advanced > Admin > Security
- Set session timeout (e.g., 900–1800 seconds), maximum login failures, and lockout time.
- Path: Advanced > Admin > Admin Base URL – set a custom Admin path.
- Verify: Failed login attempts trigger lockout; new Admin URL in use.

4) Require 2FA
- Path: Admin > Stores > Settings > Configuration > Security > 2FA
- Enable desired providers (e.g., Google Authenticator).
- Verify: Next Admin login prompts for 2FA.

5) Review permissions
- Path: Admin > System > Permissions > All Users and User Roles
- Ensure least-privilege roles and unique users.
- Verify: A non-admin role cannot access System > Extensions or Stores > Configuration.

### WAF/CDN Setup (same day)
6) Enable a WAF/CDN
- Adobe Commerce on cloud: Enable Fastly WAF rules.
- Open Source/self-hosted: Configure a WAF (Cloudflare/Akamai/Fastly) and set rate limits for login, cart, checkout, and GraphQL endpoints.
- Verify: Observe WAF blocks for scripted login attempts and abnormal request velocity.

### CSP Rollout
7) Implement CSP
- Start with Report-Only; review and fix violations.
- Move to Enforce once required sources are whitelisted (payments, analytics, tag managers).
- Verify: No CSP report violations in production during normal user journeys.

### Patching & Cadence
8) Maintain patching discipline
- Schedule monthly Composer updates to the latest 2.4.x security release; apply security-only patches when released.
- Verify: Application version matches latest security release; scanners report no known CVEs.

### Verification & Monitoring
9) Run Adobe Commerce Security Scan Tool on your domains; remediate findings (e.g., insecure headers, outdated version).
10) Ensure automated backups and log monitoring; on Adobe Commerce, enable System > Actions Logs (if available).
- Verify: Admin activity is logged; alerts trigger on anomalies.
