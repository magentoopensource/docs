## Step-by-Step Learning Path

## When Things Don't Go as Expected

Even experienced merchants encounter challenges. Here's how to handle common situations:

- Symptom: Payment method not visible at checkout
  - Likely cause: Method disabled, scope mismatch, or unsupported currency/country
  - Fix: Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods; enable method at the correct scope and ensure store currency and Allowed Countries align with the provider

### Shipping
- Symptom: No shipping methods available
  - Likely cause: Shipping Origin missing, product has no weight, or method restrictions
  - Fix: Set Origin (Stores > Configuration > Sales > Shipping Settings); ensure product Weight > 0 and In Stock; review method restrictions in Sales > Delivery Methods

### Taxes
- Symptom: Taxes not applied or incorrect
  - Likely cause: Missing tax rates/rules or default destination mismatch
  - Fix: Stores > Taxes > Tax Zones and Rates; Stores > Taxes > Tax Rules; verify Default Tax Destination Calculation (Stores > Configuration > Sales > Tax) and customer address

### Catalog & Inventory
- Symptom: Product not visible on storefront
  - Likely cause: Disabled product, wrong visibility, not assigned to website/category, or no salable qty
  - Fix: Catalog > Products: Enable Product, set Visibility = Catalog, Search; assign to website and category; ensure In Stock and quantity > 0; if needed, System > Tools > Index Management: Reindex

### Caching & Indexing
- Symptom: Changes not appearing
  - Likely cause: Cache not flushed or indexes outdated
  - Fix: System > Cache Management: Flush Magento Cache; System > Tools > Index Management: Reindex updated indexes

### Access & Security (2FA)
- Symptom: Locked out by 2FA
  - Fix: Ask an Admin with higher privileges to reset your 2FA or use backup codes per your configured provider
