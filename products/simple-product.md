- Basic understanding of your store's category structure

## Step 1: Access the Product Management Area

## Step 2: Configure Basic Product Information

### Product Name and SKU

```

**Best Practices:**

- Use descriptive product names that customers will search for
- Keep SKUs consistent and logical for inventory management

### Product Description

Fill out these key fields:

- **Short Description**: A brief overview (2-3 sentences) that appears on category pages

## Step 3: Set Product Images

### Adding Images

    - Customers can view these in the product gallery

    - **Qty for Item's Status to Become Out of Stock**: Set minimum threshold
    - **Maximum Qty Allowed in Shopping Cart**: Set purchase limits
    - **Notify for Quantity Below**: Get alerts when stock is low

## Step 5: Search Engine Optimization

### URL Key

- Create a SEO-friendly URL slug
- Use hyphens instead of spaces
- Include relevant keywords

### Meta Information

- **Meta Title**: Include product name and key terms
- **Meta Description**: Compelling description for search results
- **Meta Keywords**: Relevant search terms (optional)
