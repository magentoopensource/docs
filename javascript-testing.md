# JavaScript Testing Documentation

[TOC]

## Introduction

JavaScript testing is a crucial process in web development as it allows developers to ensure the reliability and
correctness of their code. In this documentation, we will explore the various aspects of JavaScript testing, including
testing frameworks, tools, and best practices. By following these guidelines, you will be able to write effective tests
for your JavaScript code and improve the overall quality and maintainability of your projects.

## Testing Frameworks

Testing frameworks provide a structure and set of tools to write and run tests. They typically include features such as
test runners, assertions, and mocking utilities. Let's take a look at some popular JavaScript testing frameworks:

### Jest

Jest is a widely-used testing framework developed by Facebook. It is known for its simplicity, speed, and great
developer experience. Jest provides a powerful set of features, including built-in mocking, code coverage, and snapshot
testing. Here's an example of a simple test case using Jest:

```javascript
test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);
});
```

### Mocha

Mocha is a flexible testing framework that allows you to choose your own assertion library and test runner. It provides
a clean and minimalistic API for writing tests. Mocha supports both synchronous and asynchronous testing, making it
suitable for a variety of testing scenarios. Here's an example of a Mocha test:

```javascript
const assert = require('assert');

describe('Array', () => {
    describe('#indexOf()', () => {
        it('should return -1 when the value is not present', () => {
            assert.strictEqual([1, 2, 3].indexOf(4), -1);
        });
    });
});
```

### Jasmine

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework that provides an expressive syntax for writing tests.
It aims to be easy to read and understand, making it a great choice for teams with non-technical stakeholders. Jasmine
includes built-in support for spies, mocks, and asynchronous testing. Here's an example of a Jasmine test:

```javascript
describe('Calculator', () => {
    let calculator;

    beforeEach(() => {
        calculator = new Calculator();
    });

    it('should add two numbers correctly', () => {
        expect(calculator.add(2, 3)).toEqual(5);
    });

    it('should subtract two numbers correctly', () => {
        expect(calculator.subtract(5, 2)).toEqual(3);
    });
});
```

## Unit Testing

Unit testing is a testing methodology where individual units of code, such as functions or classes, are tested in
isolation. The purpose is to verify that each unit behaves as expected and to identify any defects early in the
development process. Let's explore some best practices for unit testing JavaScript code:

### Isolate Dependencies

When writing unit tests, it is crucial to isolate dependencies to ensure that each unit is tested in isolation. This can
be achieved by using mocking or stubbing techniques. For example, in a Magento 2 module, if a JavaScript function relies
on an API call, you can use a mocking library like `sinon` to stub the API response and test the function's behavior
independently.

```javascript
// Example using sinon to stub an API call
const sinon = require('sinon');
const myModule = require('./myModule');
const api = require('./api');

describe('myModule', () => {
    it('should handle API response correctly', () => {
        const apiStub = sinon.stub(api, 'get').resolves({data: 'test'});

        return myModule.doSomething().then(() => {
            expect(apiStub.calledOnce).toBe(true);
            // assert other expectations
        });
    });
});
```

### Test Coverage

Achieving high test coverage is essential to ensure that your code is thoroughly tested. Test coverage measures the
percentage of code that is executed during tests. Various tools, such as Istanbul or Jest's built-in coverage report,
can help you analyze your code coverage. Aim to have a high level of coverage for critical and complex code paths.

### Use Test Doubles

Test doubles, such as mocks, stubs, and spies, are essential tools for unit testing. They allow you to replace real
dependencies with controlled substitutes, enabling you to test specific scenarios and behaviors. For example, you can
use a spy to verify if a function has been called with specific arguments.

```javascript
// Example using jasmine's spyOn
const myModule = require('./myModule');
const dependency = require('./dependency');

describe('myModule', () => {
    it('should call dependency function correctly', () => {
        spyOn(dependency, 'myFunction');
        myModule.doSomething();
        expect(dependency.myFunction).toHaveBeenCalledWith('test');
    });
});
```

## Integration Testing

Integration testing focuses on testing the interactions between multiple components or systems. In the context of
JavaScript, integration tests may involve testing the interaction between the frontend JavaScript code and backend APIs,
services, or databases. Here are some considerations for integration testing:

### Setup and Teardown

In integration tests, it is crucial to properly set up the test environment before each test and clean up afterward.
This ensures that each test has a consistent starting point and avoids conflicts between tests. For example, when
testing a Magento 2 module that interacts with a database, you should create a test database and populate it with the
necessary data before running the tests.

### Test Real-world Scenarios

Integration tests should cover real-world scenarios and edge cases to ensure that your JavaScript code works correctly
in a production-like environment. For example, if your JavaScript code communicates with an API, you should test various
API responses, such as success, failure, and error scenarios.

### Use Mock APIs

To avoid dependency on external systems during integration tests, you can use mock APIs or API stubs. This allows you to
simulate API responses without making actual requests to the backend. Tools like `msw` or `nock` can help you mock API
requests and responses easily.

```javascript
// Example using msw to mock API requests
import {rest} from 'msw';
import {setupServer} from 'msw/node';
import myModule from './myModule';

const server = setupServer(
    rest.get('/api/data', (req, res, ctx) => {
        return res(ctx.json({data: 'test'}));
    })
);

beforeAll(() => server.listen());
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
afterAll(() => server.close());

describe('myModule', () => {
    it('should handle API response correctly', async () => {
        const result = await myModule.fetchData();
        expect(result).toEqual({data: 'test'});
    });
});
```

## Conclusion

JavaScript testing is an essential part of the development process, allowing you to ensure the correctness and
reliability of your code. By using testing frameworks, following best practices, and writing comprehensive unit and
integration tests, you can improve the quality and maintainability of your JavaScript code. Remember to isolate
dependencies, achieve high test coverage, and use test doubles effectively. Happy testing!
